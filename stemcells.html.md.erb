**Release Date**: December 17, 2021

## Enhancements
* `/var/opt` is now mounted to the ephemeral disk rather than the root disk. This is not a recommended storage point for bosh workloads, but some agents deployed on stemcells write their logs to this folder and that could cause the root disk to fill up.

## Fixes 
* This release reverts the NATS firewall enhancement added in 621.183. Changes associated with this feature caused VMs to report a networking failed state and prevented monit firewall rules from being applied. The NATS firewall enhancement will be reintroduced in a future release.

#### <a id="621-183"></a> 621.183

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: December 06, 2021

## Enhancements
* Added firewall rules to restrict access to the NATS message bus except by the bosh agent. This provides an additional layer of security so even if an attacker is able to gain access to the NATS credentials, they would be unable to use those from a workload on a Bosh deployed VM. If you are attempting to debug NATS connectivity problems by directly connecting to the Bosh NATS server, you will need additional access; instructions can be [found here](https://bosh.io/docs/tips/#unreachable-agent).

## Known issues
Errors are present in the networking service post-start scripts for all BOSH-managed VMs which:
* Causes networking service to report a failed state
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the monit service
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the NATS service

#### <a id="621-151"></a> 621.151

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: September 14, 2021

## Fixes
* Updates the `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit` wrapper script to refer to `monit-actual` by absolute path, rather than relative path. This allows folks who reset or clear the `PATH` environment variable to actually be able to use the `monit` CLI. Prior to this fix, folks who cleared their `PATH` environment variable would see an error like: `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit: line 9: exec: monit-actual: not found`.
* Fixes the "incorrect used memory reporting" issue introduced in stemcell version `621.141`. The Bosh Agent will now report the correct amount of memory used by all processes in the VM that it manages, rather than just the processes in its cgroup.

## Known issues
* We've seen failures with this version of the stemcell in vSphere when attempting to attach a persistent disk to a running VM. We are currently planning to address this issue with an update to the vSphere CPI. It should be fixed in vSphere CPI release >= v69. We have pulled the vSphere version of this stemcell for now.

**Note**: This issue is fixed in stemcell version 621.154

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: August 30, 2021

## Enhancements
* Added firewall rules to restrict Monit API access to the Monit CLI and BOSH Agent. To see how to grant your program access to the Monit API, examine the new `monit` wrapper script, found at `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit`.

## Known issues
* The memory used by the VM that a Bosh Agent manages is incorrectly reported. The Agent will report very significantly smaller amounts of memory used by the VM than are actually used. This means that the "memory used" information in the output of `bosh vms --vitals` and related commands is incorrect. For now, avoid using this stemcell version, if you rely on the VM memory usage information reported by the Bosh Agent, Director, or the `bosh` CLI.
**NOTE**: This issue has been resolved in Stemcell version 621.151.

**Release Date**: July 26, 2021

## Metadata:
**BOSH Agent Version**: 2.268.21

## USNs:

**Title**: USN-4336-2: GNU binutils vulnerabilities
**URL**: https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4336-2
**Priorities**: low,medium
**Description**:
  USN-4336-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. This update provides
the corresponding update for Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a large number of security
 issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
 specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to
 crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary
 code.

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: March 05, 2021

## Fixes Issues:

GCP rsyslog behavior is fixed - cf ssh and rsyslog should be working as expected

## Important Notice:

As of this release, on all IAASs, rsyslog will not start until `/var/log` is mounted. When used with a Bosh Agent, `/var/log` will automatically be mounted, and no further action is required.

If you use this stemcell without a Bosh Agent and do not mount `/var/log`, then you need to do one of these two actions:

* Remove the `ExecStartPre=` line from `/etc/systemd/system/rsyslog.service`
* Blank out the contents of `/usr/local/bin/wait_for_var_log_to_be_mounted`

Either action will cause rsyslog to no longer wait for `/var/log` to be mounted before starting.

**Release Date**: March 01, 2021

**Known Issues**: 

This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:
* Attempts to use `cf ssh` timeout. 
* The `iptables-logger` job fails to deploy

This is because rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.

This issue is fixed in stemcell version 621.109.

 <br>- https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2021-27135

**Known Issues**: When used on GCP, rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.

#### <a id="621-107"></a> 621.107

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: February 24, 2021

**Known Issues**: 

This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:
* Attempts to use `cf ssh` timeout. 
* The `iptables-logger` job fails to deploy

This is because rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.

This issue is fixed in stemcell version 621.109.

#### <a id="456-213"></a> 456.213

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: December 06, 2021

## Enhancements
* Added firewall rules to restrict access to the NATS message bus except by the bosh agent. This provides an additional layer of security so even if an attacker is able to gain access to the NATS credentials, they would be unable to use those from a workload on a Bosh deployed VM. If you are attempting to debug NATS connectivity problems by directly connecting to the Bosh NATS server, you will need additional access; instructions can be [found here](https://bosh.io/docs/tips/#unreachable-agent).

## Known Issue:
Errors are present in the networking service post-start scripts for all BOSH-managed VMs which:

* Causes networking service to report a failed state
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the monit service
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the NATS service

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: September 14, 2021

## Fixes
* Updates the `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit` wrapper script to refer to `monit-actual` by absolute path, rather than relative path. This allows folks who reset or clear the `PATH` environment variable to actually be able to use the `monit` CLI. Prior to this fix, folks who cleared their `PATH` environment variable would see an error like: `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit: line 9: exec: monit-actual: not found`.
* Fixes the "incorrect used memory reporting" issue introduced in stemcell version `456.176`. The Bosh Agent will now report the correct amount of memory used by all processes in the VM that it manages, rather than just the processes in its cgroup.

## Known issues
* We've seen failures with this version of the stemcell in vSphere when attempting to attach a persistent disk to a running VM. We are currently planning to address this issue with an update to the vSphere CPI. It should be fixed in vSphere CPI release >= v69. We have pulled the vSphere version of this stemcell.

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: August 30, 2021

## Enhancements
* Added firewall rules to restrict Monit API access to the Monit CLI and BOSH Agent. To see how to grant your program access to the Monit API, examine the new `monit` wrapper script, found at `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit`.

## Known issues
* The memory used by the VM that a Bosh Agent manages is incorrectly reported. The Agent will report very significantly smaller amounts of memory used by the VM than are actually used. This means that the "memory used" information in the output of `bosh vms --vitals` and related commands is incorrect. For now, avoid using this stemcell version, if you rely on the VM memory usage information reported by the Bosh Agent, Director, or the `bosh` CLI. 
**NOTE**: This issue has been resolved in Stemcell version 456.186.

**Release Date**: July 26, 2021

## Metadata:
**BOSH Agent Version**: 2.234.12

## USNs:

**Title**: USN-4336-2: GNU binutils vulnerabilities
**URL**: https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4336-2
**Priorities**: low,medium
**Description**:
  USN-4336-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. This update provides
the corresponding update for Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a large number of security
 issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
 specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to
 crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary
 code.

**Release Date**: March 05, 2021

## Fixes Issues:

GCP rsyslog behavior is fixed - cf ssh and rsyslog should be working as expected

## Important Notice:

As of this release, on all IAASs, rsyslog will not start until `/var/log` is mounted. When used with a Bosh Agent, `/var/log` will automatically be mounted, and no further action is required.

If you use this stemcell without a Bosh Agent and do not mount `/var/log`, then you need to do one of these two actions:

* Remove the `ExecStartPre=` line from `/etc/systemd/system/rsyslog.service`
* Blank out the contents of `/usr/local/bin/wait_for_var_log_to_be_mounted`

Either action will cause rsyslog to no longer wait for `/var/log` to be mounted before starting.

**Known Issues**: 

This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:
* Attempts to use `cf ssh` timeout. 
* The `iptables-logger` job fails to deploy

This is because rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.
